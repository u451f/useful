Create a container file with random bits:
	dd if="/dev/urandom" of="/home/amnesia/Persistent/secret" bs=1M count=100

... where "100" is the size in Megabytes

Mount this file to a loop device:

Then go to Applications -> System tools -> disk utility

Click on .secret on the left hand side.
Then click on "Format volume". Use ext4 and click on "Encrypt underlying device".
You should then see 2 "partitions".


This is all for the initial setup.
